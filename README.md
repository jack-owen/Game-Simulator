  Toy Robot Simulator
</h1>

A Node.js Toy Robot Simulator application of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 x 5. Jest unit tests are provided for testing the application functions, along with illegal edge cases that check the application wouldn't allow the robot to exceed to 5x5 board dimensions, etc.

The Node app starts from the index.js file to handle the user input stream. The game functionality runs in ToyRobotSimulator.js
